## Setup

### Step 1: Generate Your Client ID and Secret

To authenticate with the OSM API, you'll need a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Follow these steps to generate them:

1. Log in to [Online Scout Manager (OSM)](https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk).
2. Expand the **Settings** menu at the bottom of the page.
3. Select **My Account Details**.
4. Click **Developer Tools** from the menu on the left-hand side.
5. Click **Create Application**.
6. Provide a name for your application and click **Save**.
7. The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed **once only**. Make sure to copy and save them securely.

### Step 2: Authenticate with OSM

1. Go to **OSM Settings** in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Click on the **Authentication** tab.
3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4. Click **Save & Authenticate** to validate your credentials.

### Step 3: Enable Sections

1. Navigate to the **Sections Enabled** tab.
2. Select the sections you want to enable by ticking the checkboxes.
3. Click **Save Sections**. The plugin will automatically fetch and cache the current term for each enabled section.

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

1. Go to the **General** tab.
2. Verify that your enabled sections are listed along with their current term IDs.
3. If needed, use the **Purge Cache** or **Reset Configuration** options.

## Usage

### Shortcodes

Use the following shortcodes to display OSM data on your website, you'll be able to find the Section ID in the general tab of the settings menu:

#### Programme Shortcode

```plaintext
[osm_programme sectionid="SECTION_ID" futureonly="true"]
```

- **sectionid** (required): The ID of the section to display.
- **futureonly** (optional): Set to `true` to show only future events. Default: `false`.

Example:

```plaintext
[osm_programme sectionid="12345" futureonly="true"]
```

#### Events Shortcode

```plaintext
[osm_events sectionid="SECTION_ID" futureonly="true"]
```

- **sectionid** (required): The ID of the section to display.
- **futureonly** (optional): Set to `true` to show only future events. Default: `false`.

Example:

```plaintext
[osm_events sectionid="67890" futureonly="false"]
```

---


#### Waiting List Shortcode

```plaintext
[osm_waiting_list]
```

Shows a public form for joining an OSM waiting list. Set the target **waiting-list section ID** under **OSM Settings → Waiting List** before publishing the form. There is no hardcoded default section.

Example for testing only: the 4th Ashby waiting list section ID is `60830`. Other groups must enter their own section ID in the admin setting — do not treat `60830` as a default that submits anywhere.

**Required fields:** child first name, last name, date of birth (UK day/month/year), postcode; parent 1 first name, last name, email, phone; consent checkbox.

**Optional fields:** address line 1, town; parent 2 first name, last name, email, phone (if any parent 2 field is filled, first name, last name, and email become required).

On a successful OSM write, the submission is **not** stored in WordPress. The form uses a WordPress nonce, a honeypot field, server-side validation, and a simple per-IP rate limit.

Your OSM OAuth application needs the `section:member:write` scope in addition to the existing programme/event read scopes. Re-authenticate under **OSM Settings → Authentication** after updating so a fresh token is issued.
